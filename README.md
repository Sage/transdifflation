# Transdifflation

What is Transdifflation? Transdifflation is an acronym of 'Translation' and 'Diff'.  
It compares two .yml locate files, one in your source code (target) and one in others' (gems, other projects) source code (source) and generates a beside-file with the keys you hadn't translated yet.  
Then you can merge it. It is designed to detect changes between versions. By now, target file cannot be renamed, and it is generated in 'config/locales/' + to_locale (param in task). Names are inferred by the task params too.

IT NEVER CHANGES YOUR SOURCE FILE, unless it doesn't exists, so it creates for you. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'transdifflation'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install transdifflation

## Usage

It needs a config file (**transdifflation.yml**) placed on your host root, or in 'config'. If not exists, a rake task is set up to generate it: ```rake transdifflation:config```. Config file looks like:

```yml
tasks:
  task_name1: {
    desc: 'Get diff translation from file config/locales/en.yml gem gem_name',
    type: gem,
    params: {
      gem_name: 'gem_name',
      path_in_gem: 'config/locales/en.yml',
      from_locale: 'en',
      to_locale: 'es'
    }
  }
  task_name2: {
    desc: 'Get diff translation from file config/locales/en.yml file in file_path',
    type: file,
    params: {
      tag_name: 'tag_for_file',
      file_path_from_rails_root: '../another_project/config/locales/en.yml',
      from_locale: 'en',
      to_locale: 'fr'
    }
  }
grouped_tasks:
  task_group_name: 
    - task_name1
    - task_name2
```

These nodes generates rake tasks. There are two types of tasks:

*   type **gem**: When it rans, it checks where the gem 'gem_name' is installed, and looks inside the gem for the file located in 'path_in_gem'. It uses from_locale and to_locale to translate names and keys inside yaml.

*   type **file**: When it rans, it looks for the file in 'file_path_from_rails_root' is installed. It uses from_locale and to_locale to translate names and keys inside yaml. Tag_name is used to name target file in our host.

Also, you can create grouped tasks in a node called 'grouped_taks'. Task **all** is automatially generated.  

Execute ```rake -T``` to determine sucess of config file. Your tasks should appear there, under namespace ```transdifflation:```
